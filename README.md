Business Problem
● Trade & Ahead is a financial consultancy firm who provide their customers with personalized 
investment strategies. With a List of stock price and some financial indicators for a few 
companies listed under the New York Stock Exchange, the company decided to analyze the 
data, group the stocks based on the attributes provided, and share insights about the 
characteristics of each group.
● By doing a cluster analysis, the company aims to identify stocks that exhibit similar 
characteristics and ones that exhibit minimum correlation. This will help investors pick better 
stocks across different market segments and protect the portfolio against risks that could 
make it vulnerable to losses.

Technique used for analysis : Clustering
